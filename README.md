# Building a Simple Database in Rust

[![Conventional Commits](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conventional%20Commits-1.0.0-yellow.svg)](https://conventionalcommits.org)

In this educational project I seek to understand
how databases work and to practice my Rust skills.

I'm following [this 13 part tutorial](https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/).

The repository of that project can be found [here](https://github.com/cstack/db_tutorial).
The person that wrote that tutorial mainly used C but as I mentioned I'll be using the Rust
programming language to complete this project for no particular reason, other than practice.
